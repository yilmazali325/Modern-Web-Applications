Answer1: While settimeout schedules a callback to run after a specific time,the functions are registered in the timers phase of the event loop.On the other hand, setImmediate will schedule a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events' callbacks.So if the opearation you want it to be done are not require events like I/O callbacks, idle,prepare or incoming:connections,data, then you should call setImmediate to start from check phase.The operations that needs phases like I/O callbacks,idle,prepare and incoming:connections,data and then check will need to start from Timer phase.So in this time we need to use setTimeout.
Answer2:SetImmediate start to operate from check phase and than close.On the other hand, process.nextTick has its own other queue.It is like priority queue and it does its job before setImmediate does its job.So if we have a operation that needs to be done immediately we need to use process.nextTick.It is dangereous because if we use it a lot it can block the loop.So we need to be careful to use it.
